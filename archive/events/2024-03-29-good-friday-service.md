FCC will be having a Good Friday service at Meadowbrook. Good Friday worship is a time for Christians to contemplate the suffering endured by Jesus Christ as He selflessly gave His life to atone for our sins. The reflection deepens our gratitude and joy that accompanies our celebration of new life in Christ on Easter Sunday. Children are welcome but no childcare will be available.
