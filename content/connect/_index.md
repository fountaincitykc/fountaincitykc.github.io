      Gathering in smaller groups throughout the week allows us to grow in relationship with God and with others in a more personal setting. Sharing meals in homes, we discuss life and God's Word, and pray for one another. An extension of Sunday worship in a way, Home Groups provide space to grow in faith while connecting more deeply with others.

      A casual meet&ndash;up at local parks gives moms space to connect while kids play together. The parks are on a rotation to provide a variety of scenery and geography. A great place to build relationships, meet other moms in similar life stages, and have fun!

      We believe that God the Creator of all things designed us to know Him, and designed us to find rich, abundant meaningful life in relationship with Him through Jesus Christ. If you are curious about Jesus, or have questions, we'd be glad to talk.
