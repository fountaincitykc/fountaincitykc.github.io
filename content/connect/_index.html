description: "Gathering in smaller groups throughout the week allows us to grow in relationship with God and with others in a more personal setting. Sharing meals in homes, we discuss life and God's Word, and pray for one another. An extension of Sunday worship in a way, Home Groups provide space to grow in faith while connecting more deeply with others."
