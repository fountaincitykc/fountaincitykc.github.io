As we head into a new year, it's common to reflect on big, all-encompassing life questions. Questions like, who am I, what do I want to accomplish with my, why am I here? This week, we'll explore how we all can answer these questions in meaningful, God-given ways. Because of what Jesus has done for us, have been given deep purpose and a meaningful role to play in all of our life, every day.
