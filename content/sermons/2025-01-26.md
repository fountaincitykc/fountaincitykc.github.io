In our culture anything that feels like suffering is typically seen as detracting from the life that will allow "you to be you". The Apostle Peter shows us that as a Christian, suffering is likely, expected even. If I suffer as a Christian, is our culture's assessment right? Am I wasting my life? Have I been duped? Peter's answer to these questions will not only help us rightly understand suffering, but help us see it as a blessing that leads us closer to God.
