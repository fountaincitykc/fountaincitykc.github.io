Life is filled with difficult circumstances that can negatively our faith. The Bible occasionally talks about people abandoning their faith as though they've shipwrecked their faith. And this raises the question of how can we stay strong and hold to our faith in the midst of hardships? From Acts 14, we'll see there's great hope and encouragement for us, and at the center of it is a strength we all want and need: God's strength.
