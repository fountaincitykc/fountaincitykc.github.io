A well known statement in the Bible says that “Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.” The reality is faith can be hard. Many people struggle to believe that something is true; we doubt, we question. On this Resurrection Sunday, Jesus will meet us here, in belief and doubt. He wants to meet us to move us; to move beyond our doubt to solid, biblical faith and through an encounter with Thomas, that's just what He'll do.
