At the heart of the Advent season is a promise about Jesus. But promises are only valuable if theyâ€™re kept; if we put our hope in a promise, but that promise is broken, that can feel unbearable.  It would be better to not trust that kind of promise to begin with. A lot of us experience our relationship with God that way, even in Advent. Through this passage, God will show us that we can have complete comfort in his promises because we know he will always keep them.
