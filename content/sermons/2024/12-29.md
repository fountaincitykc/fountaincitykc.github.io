This past season was likely filled with warm relationships, joy, and memories. Now, this week or the next, life gets back to normal for most of us. Real, everyday life is often hard. It might be filled by disease, job loss, or unresolved conflict you have to deal with. Real life can make the joy of the gospel seem only like a seasonal thing. As we'll see in this week, the advent season is of course meant to bless us now, but even more so, to point to us the ultimate joy and peace that awaits.
