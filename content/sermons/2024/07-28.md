Our church's vision is that we would be a Christ centered church making and sending disciples in this generation and the next. At the heart of that calling is a truth that is found in the heart of God, something that Jesus makes very plain and powerful in the parables of this passage, and something that will refresh and energize us: no matter how far from God we might be, he seeks us, saves us, and celebrates our relationship with him.
