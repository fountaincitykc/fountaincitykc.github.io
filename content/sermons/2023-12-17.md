There's longing that runs through every culture throughout time that can be hard to put into words. We can all see that our world is a broken place and when we're honest, we know that we ourselves are broken people.  The longing we have is for this world and for our lives to be made whole; to be restored. The good news in this Advent season is that we are not longing in vain, but longing for what God has promised he will do. Jesus, our Prince of Peace, is coming to make everything whole.
