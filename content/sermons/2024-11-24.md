Living faithfully in everyday life has been, is now, and will be nuanced and complex. So, how does Peter expect us to discern what is good for us to do? How are we to be devoted to God but also mindful of our neighbor? Lastly, who has the final say on who we are and what we've done? Was any of it worth it? In 1 Peter 3:13-22, the Apostle Peter lifts our eyes to the great hope we have in every circumstance as we are in Christ so too do we share in his victory.
