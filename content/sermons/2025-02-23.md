Last week, as we dove into gospel renewal, we saw that Jesus renews us from the inside out by first changing what we treasure in life, to be him. This Sunday, we are going to press WHY this is so hard. Jesus is going to place his finger on the main thing that keeps us from putting him first so that he can uproot it and give us what is infinitely better.
