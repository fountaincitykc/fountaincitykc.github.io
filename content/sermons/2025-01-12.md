There's something about the start of a New Year, the feel of it, that connects pretty easily with our Christian faith. A New Year can feel as though it offers us a new beginning, an opportunity for change, something different. As we return to Peter's letter this Sunday, he will draw a sharp connection between that New Year feeling and the call of the gospel. The gospel of Jesus calls us into a new life. The question Peter will put before us all this morning is are you owning that new life?
