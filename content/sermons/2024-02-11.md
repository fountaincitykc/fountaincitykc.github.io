The name of our church draws influence from Kansas City, being the City of Fountains, but it signifies more than that. Behind our name is a reality that transcends our church and extends to all of Jesus's people and churches. It's a reality that gets at something core to our identity as disciples of Jesus; that we are sent. And as a sent church, we believe that core to Jesus' calling to us is to be a church that sends disciples.
