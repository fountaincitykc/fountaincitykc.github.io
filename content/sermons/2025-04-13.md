Perhaps one of the more impressive and intimidating things we see in others is when they share their faith in Jesus. We might think, 'how do they do that', or 'where do they get the courage?' As we conclude our sermon series on Gospel Renewal from the inside out, we'll see that the secret in sharing our faith is not guilt or goals or fear, but joy. It's joy that comes from a heart changed by grace. Experiencing deep, transformative grace leads to joyful witness to the giver of that grace.
