This Advent season we've been tracing the promise of God running through the whole of Scripture: that He will send One to overcome our sorrow and shame. But a nagging question hanging over this promise is who is it for? Through this beautiful passage, God will make it very clear that He sends the promised One for all of us, and He invites us all to respond with joyful worship.
