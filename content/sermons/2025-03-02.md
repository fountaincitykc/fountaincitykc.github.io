The Good Samaritan is a parable that is familiar to nearly everyone, at least by name. Because of that familiarity, it's easy to lose sight of the revolutionary message Jesus intends it to have. As we continue to look at how, through the gospel, Jesus renews us and our hearts, we'll see that He also brings His renewing grace to those around us as we begin to love others as He has loved us.
