As we open our series through Proverbs, the author will show us that a fulfilling, happy, meaningful life is built on one key theme: wisdom. He makes that case that a good life, a life well lived, is a wise life. But that's not all; he will also tell us how we can acquire this wise life. And his direction might surprise you. Wisdom doesn't begin with books and degrees and experience, but with healthy fear.
