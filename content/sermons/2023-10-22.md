One of the biggest problems Christians have is with our memory. Many of us have stories of how Jesus has changed our lives, but for some reason we can so easily forget this happened. In this amazing story from Acts 16, God is going to jog our memory and open our vision to the reality that leads us to worship week after week: Jesus is alive, and Jesus changes lives in any place and at any time, even when we least expect it.
