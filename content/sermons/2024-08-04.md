Any talk of discipleship must always begin in one place, with Jesus. The only reason we talk about being and making believers, followers and learners of Jesus, is because of who Jesus is. And if we don’t know who Jesus is, then we’ll never properly understand what it means for us to be his disciples. This week, from John's gospel, one brief statement from the mouth of Jesus will help us see him with utmost clarity, and with that vision, see that he is worthy of our entire life.
