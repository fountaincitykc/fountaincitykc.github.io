One of the greatest struggles we experience in life is figuring out who we are. What's our identity?

Or we might look to our earned qualities: our education, profession, relationships. How often do we first look to what God says? In Christ, God gives us an identity that should come before any other and He wants us to take hold of our identity as His child.
