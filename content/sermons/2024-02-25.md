If you could ask Jesus to do one thing in your life, your community, someone close to you, what would you ask him? Our answers give us a picture that grounds our church's vision: gospel renewal. Jesus is moving all things from the failure of the garden to the glory of new creation and he's working through us, his church, to do it. What kind of expectations does Jesus want us to have for what he's doing in us and through us? The answer we'll see is probably more than we think.
