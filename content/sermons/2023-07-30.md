The majority of our lives are boring, ordinary, and mundane: we go to work, take care of our home, spend time with family. Occasionally we experience pain and loss: lost dreams, lost friends, lost loved ones. Where is God in the midst of that? Through this little book, God will show us that throughout all our life He is there and He is at work. In Christ He has committed Himself to our good, and He works for that. In response, God wants us to commit ourselves to Him.
