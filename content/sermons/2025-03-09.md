One of the most difficult actions of the Christian faith is forgiveness. In our culture, forgiveness can be spoken of as a mistake. In our personal lives, the thought of forgiving those who have hurt us can feel impossible and unjust. As we continue looking into the renewing work that Jesus does in those who trust and follow him, we'll see that forgiveness is in the center. In fact, what Jesus wants us to understand is that he is changing our hearts so we can forgive others as He has forgiven us.
