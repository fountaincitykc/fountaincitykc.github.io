An experience we likely all share is some kind of second-guessing major decisions in our lives. Usually it happens after something goes wrong or things donâ€™t turn out the way we thought they would. None of us likes to live with a nagging doubt or insecurity. We want the assurance and peace that comes with confidence. This is especially true when it comes to matters of faith. In this passage, we'll see that God wants to assure us that we can have complete confidence that placing our faith in Jesus is the right choice.
