Is a Christian’s life supposed to change? If so, how is that change possible? What is life with God meant to look like here and now? In 1 Peter 2:11-12, Peter urges his listeners to live as redeemed people who reject their former ways and live in this world for God’s glory.

Guest Speaker Adam Jones
