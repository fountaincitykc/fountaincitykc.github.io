One of the great joys as a parent is watching your children grow up. It can be truly amazing to observe a tiny infant grow into a capable, conversant teenager. From this week's passage, Peter will affirm this joy of development but, as he does, we'll see that those in focus, those who are growing up, are us. Peter reminds us all of the amazing claim the Bible makes about Chrisitians; that through our faith in Jesus, we have been born again into a new life. And like a newborn baby, the goal is for us to grow up in this new life. And we do that by seeking more and more of one who's given this life to us: Jesus.
