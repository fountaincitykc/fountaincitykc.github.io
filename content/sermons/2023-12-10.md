A theme that transcends time and culture, that works its way into literature, music and fine art is the desire of wanting to go home. Home is that place where we belong, where we're protected and provided for, where we're reminded of who we truly are. This week, from the prophet Isaiah, we'll see that because Jesus is our Everlasting Father, we can look forward to what our hearts long for: going to our true home.
