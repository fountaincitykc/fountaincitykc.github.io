As a Christian, negativity toward our faith can be intimidating and it can create confusion or doubt. That’s understandable, but through this passage God wants us to see the truth of the matter; to be reminded of the reason why we’re called to be a Christ centered church making and sending disciples in the generation and the next. That’s because the gospel is not a problem but the power of God for salvation for all who will believe.
