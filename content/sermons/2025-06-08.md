There's an underlying angst we all feel, Christian or not, wondering if we will be ok. As Christians, we often experience an additional kind of angst, driven more from insecurities in our faith. Do you ever find yourself worrying if you are ok with God, or worrying if one day you're going to do something that causes him to reject you? As Paul closes this amazing chapter, he gives us one of the most powerful assurances: that in Christ, everything will be ok and we have nothing to fear.
