One of the challenges of understanding the Bible comes from translating ancient customs into modern life. But a reality that transcends time and culture is one that Peter introduced to us last week: life under authority. That theme continues this week but with a more everyday focus, and a more life-shaping outcome. How does being a disciple of Jesus shape how we live under authority, even under unjust authority? Peter will show us that our discipleship to Jesus will develop a cross-shaped life.
