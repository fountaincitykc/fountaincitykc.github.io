We return this week to our study of the book of Acts. In this passage, as we come across a pivotal moment in the history of the Christian Church, the moment taking place in this passage shows us that a life that puts faith in Jesus Christ is a life that has been given a role, a part to play, in God's greater story for this world. And that role is driven by two verbs: in Christ we are SENT, because in Christ we are SAVED.
