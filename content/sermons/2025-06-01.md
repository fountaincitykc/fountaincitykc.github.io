These verses in Romans 8 can feel like standing on a mountain summit overlooking a vista that leaves you at a loss for words. At the center of this passage are two truths: God's sovereignty and our assurance in Christ. When they are put together, the promise God makes is one that will change how we both see our lives and live our lives. No matter you current circumstances, no matter your failures, no matter your limitations, in Christ, God has given you life as good as it gets.
