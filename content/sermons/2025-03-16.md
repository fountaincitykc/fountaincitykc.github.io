One of the most challenging questions of the Christian life is: how does our behavior fit in? It's so easy to begin to wonder one of two things: is God's love for me dependent on what I do, or, is what I do irrelevant and makes no difference in my life with God? Through this familiar and amazing passage, we'll see that the key is grace. Grace is free: it comes to us in spite of what we do. But to be God's grace, it also has a powerful effect. So we'll see that a saved life is a changed life.
