One of the key themes of Advent is waiting. Just like kids have to wait until the glory of Christmas morning, we have to wait for the full glory of our life in Christ. Often waiting is hard, sometimes our waiting is full of grief, pain, and tears because we long for a healing but we're powerless in our situation. This week we will see what it means for Jesus, our Mighty God, to enter our waiting; and the good news we'll see is that Jesus our Mighty God will turn our weeping into rejoicing.
