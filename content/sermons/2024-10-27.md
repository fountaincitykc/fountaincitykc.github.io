Politics and government might be the most heated topic of our shared life today, and it’s one we as Christians need to understand in the context of God’s Word. Of all that Scripture says, there isn't much that directly speaks to government and our life as Christians under it, however this passage in 1 Peter is one of the clearest and most direct teachings. Peter says we should submit to all human authority as God's free people, which isn't difficult to understand, but hard to apply.
