G.K. Chesterson once said that the Christian life has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried. As disciples of Jesus, as Christians living out the Christian life in our specific circumstances and contexts, we have all been called to a certain kind of life, a way of life, that is rarely easy or well understood: the way of holiness. As Peter will make clear to us this week, we are called to be holy as God is holy. What Peter will also make clear is that surrounding that call, envisioning it, fueling it, is something crucial that we must all keep front and center everyday: hope. He will encourage us to let our hope in Jesus lead to a holy life in Jesus.
