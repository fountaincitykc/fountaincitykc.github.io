When I ask people what's the one thing they'd want to ask Jesus to do in and around their life, the most popular answer is make peace. This passage will ask us to consider if there is ever anything we should put ahead of peace and the answer will be, "Yes". As much as we want peace, and as much as Jesus calls us to be peacemakers, Jesus also wants us to pursue truth; to be truth-tellers. That's because it's more loving to give people the truth of Jesus than a false peace.
