One of the most glorious and yet most difficult relationships in life is marriage. Some people, because of the difficulty, have grown jaded and calloused and given up. In this passage, Peter will lead us into the heart of what difference faith in Jesus makes in all this. A disciple of Jesus develops a cross-shaped life, and this life transforms marriage from a power struggle to a relationship of sacrificial love.
