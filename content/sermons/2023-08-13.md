One of the many reasons the book of Ruth is so loved is because it gives us a window into what life with God looks like in real life. When there's no miracles and no angels, how can we know what God is doing, and what God wants us to do? Sometimes the answer to those questions calls for risk, and situations with risk calls for courage. Through this week's amazing story, we'll see that while life God calls for courage, life with God also produces courage.
