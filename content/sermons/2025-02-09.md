One of the great metaphors for life is a journey and part of any journey, definitely part of our lives, is the reality that there are many struggles we must endure. Peter has made clear that sometimes we encounter these struggles because we are Christians. As we finish this letter, Peter's final word is a word of encouragement that we can and will endure all struggles by standing in grace.
