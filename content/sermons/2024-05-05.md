For many of us, a nightmare situation we dread is that we'll wake up one day, when our life is coming to an end, and realize weâ€™ve wasted our whole life. How can we have any confidence that our lives will have any real meaning or lasting impact? This week's passage will show us that a life that follows Jesus is a life full of meaning. So, we can live confidently and with courage because we know that in Christ, none our life will be a waste.
