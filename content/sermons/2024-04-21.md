A question I've been asking people for months is, "If you could ask Jesus to do one thing in your life, your family, your neighborhood, what would it be?" The one thing I've heard the most is the desire for peace; the desire for wholeness, rest, health, rightness. In a time like ours, that can feel pretty far-fetched, but it's not. Our passage this week will affirm our desire for peace, show us where we can find it, and also show us we each are the ones Jesus might use to make it.
