If you could ask Jesus to do one thing in your community or in the lives of people close to you, what would that be? The answers we might give would likely be varied, but together they belong to a phrase that gives the basis of the vision for our church: Gospel Renewal. Behind our vision is a defining "Why": why have and pursue this vision? Because through Jesus and his church, God is moving all things from the failure of the garden to the glory of new creation.
