If what Peter says is right, Christians ought to expect suffering, but why would we add that to all the other heartbreak and hardships we face? As Peter transitions toward his closing thoughts, he reminds us of the center of our hope. This hope is not only comforting for us in times of difficulty, but, what's more, it recalibrates how we relate to one another in our ordinary lives -- beginning first in our churches and spreading out to our families, friends, neighborhoods, and workplaces.
