What does it mean to have something at the center of your life? That word, center, can be a verb like focus or aim. It can also be a noun like heart.  What's the focus, aim, or heart of your life? In the introduction to his letter to the Christians in the Corinth, Paul laid out a strong case that for a Christian the only possible center is Jesus himself. And the same goes for a church. A Christ centered church keeps Christ at the center. That's what we, Fountain City Church, want to be and do.
