Life is full of promises. Promises offer confidence about the future; they offer us hope. In our modern era, we are promised that through human achievement, we'll all reach a utopian life together. The Advent season reminds us of the truth that there is only one grand promise that will actually be fulfilled. It's the ancient promise found in this all important passage, the promise that found its fulfillment in Jesus Christ, and the only promise you should bank your life on.
