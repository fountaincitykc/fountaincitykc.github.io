In 1979, Bob Dylan wrote a song with a chorus saying "You're gonna serve somebody, it might be the devil or it might be the Lord, but you're gonna serve somebody". I think he's right. I think the Bible says Bob Dylan's right. All of us serve something or someone. This passage will press us to look into our hearts and reflect on what or whom we serve. What King do you serve, because we're all gonna serve somebody.
