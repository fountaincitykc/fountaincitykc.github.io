This week, as we reflect on the good news of Christmas, that in Christ God's grace has come to us all, we'll take a deeper look at what God intends for this gift of grace to do in our lives. What is it that Jesus has come to do for us? Could our view or understanding of life with Jesus be too small? Through one of the Bible's best known passages, we'll see that God's gift of grace through Christ is so powerful in our lives that you can say we are born again.
