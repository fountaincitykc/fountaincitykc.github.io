On Christmas Eve, gifts will be on all our minds. What am I getting? Will my family like what I got them? Gifts are things we love to give and receive.  And when we give them, they are things we're excited for others to receive. On Christmas Eve we are reminded of the truth that God is a gift giver and so presents us all with a choice: will we accept God's gift or not?  Through the example of Mary, we'll see that there's no better response than to receive it with joy.
