In the early 2000's, Robert Putnam's book Bowling Alone sparked a conversation about the growing sense of loneliness and isolation in America. We feel the longing for deeper relationships, for community, for friendship. This week, the writers of the book of Proverbs will show us where this longing comes from and why it's good. The wisdom of the sages won't surprise us: the good news is that not only is friendship possible, but in Christ, it's already ours.
