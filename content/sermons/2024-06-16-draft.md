A frightening reality of life is that at any moment we could find ourselves in the midst of a tragic event and that thought can leading us to wonder if we'd make it through. As a Christian we might ask, could I still hold fast to Jesus? If you faced the worst, what would give you hope, strength, help in the midst of it? Our passage is going to lead us to the answer we all want to hear: YES, you will. Because nothing can overcome Godâ€™s promise and his grace.
