One of the most stark contrasts in our Christian faith is between self-righteousness and grace. Nothing causes us to miss Jesus more than self-righteousness, and nothing brings us deeper into the rest Jesus gives than receiving his grace. Through this amazing parable we will see that core to the work Jesus wants to do in our lives is uproot self-righteousness from our heart and fill it in with grace, so that we can rest in the gospel.
