Water is one of the Bible's dominant themes and images. Water cleanses, renews, wipes away. It also quenches. In the middle of his ministry, Jesus said something about water that helps us understand who he is and what he wants to do in our lives. It also helps us understand how Jesus wants us to see his vision for us as disciples. As his disciples, we are sent into the world with living water that only Jesus can give.
