As we continue our exploration of the wisdom of Proverbs, we come to a topic that all current measures and metrics suggest is crucial: money and wealth. Financial difficulties are the leading stressors in marriages and families, as well in many mental health issues. Statistics show that most Americans are struggling to keep their heads above "financial" water, and that managing our finances is becoming more and more difficult in this changing world. There is good news for us in the Proverbs. There is real help, real wisdom. From a sage named Agur, we'll learn that wisdom with our wealth begins with knowing what is most valuable in our life. And from the rest of the writings, we'll see that this knowledge leads to real help, real wisdom with our everyday finances.
