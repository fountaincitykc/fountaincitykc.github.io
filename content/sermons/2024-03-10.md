So much of the book of Acts is about growth; growth of the gospel, growth of believers, growth of the church. It's easy to read this history of the early church, or even to hear ministry leaders talk about similar events in our generation, and think, "That's not my life. My life is way more ordinary than that." This week, from this passage, we'll see that God's goal is the growth of the gospel, and we are all a part of that...no matter how ordinary our lives may appear.
