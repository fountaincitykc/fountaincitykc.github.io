The final words that someone speaks carry a special kind of importance. In this passage, we'll hear afresh Jesus's final words to us: Go and make disciples.

What Jesus wants us to see is something intensely personal that involves us all: a disciple is someone who has bound their life to Jesus and helps others do the same.
