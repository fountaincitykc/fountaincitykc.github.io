Words have incredible power.  Words create, destroy, divide, save.  Words can set the trajectory of your entire life.  Who hasn't said something only to seconds later wish to "unsay" it because they know what was said will do real damage?  Or positively, who hasn't had someone say something to them that changed their day or even their life for the good?  Of all of the wisdom the book of Proverbs gives, words are one of two things the book speaks to the most.  Wisdom is the skill to live our lives well.  Central to that is using our words wisely.  What the authors want us to see more than anything is that your words have incredible power; let them be a blessing.
