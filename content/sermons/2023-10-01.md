The truth and meaning of the entire gospel of Jesus Christ depends on how one responds to the central claim in this passage; the answer to the question: "What makes me right with God?" The gospel is that you and I are made right with God by Jesus' righteousness, his alone, and it's a gift given to anyone who will accept, free of charge.
