There are many claims in our Christian faith that are mysterious. We know they're true, but we can't understand how they "work". One of these involves the ministry of the Holy Spirit in our lives.  Another might be the topic of prayer. As the Apostle Paul continues to list all the ways the Holy Spirit impacts our lives, he'll show us that not only does the Holy Spirit help us and empower our prayers, the Holy Spirit also prays for us in ways we could never pray for ourselves.
