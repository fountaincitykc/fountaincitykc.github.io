In this passage, the Apostle Paul lays out a description of life that can resemble Charles Dickens' famous opening line in A Tale of Two Cities, only in Romans 8:1-11, Paul might say, "It was the best of lives, it was the worst of lives." Paul will show us there is one of two ways, one of two types of Existence we can choose to live. What we'll see this week is that Jesus wants us to take hold of the freedom He's given us through His Spirit.
