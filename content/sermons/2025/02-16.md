One of Jesus' favorite questions to ask was "What do you want me to do for you?" If we could hear Jesus ask us that question, how would we answer? Through Jesus, God is moving this broken, fallen world to a glorious new creation: gospel renewal. A second question to consider is, how does this gospel reality go from the academic to something personally meaningful? It happens when we see that this renewal is something Jesus is doing in us right now and he begins by focusing on what we love.
