Relationships can carry a lot of extras with them. Extra people, extra priorities, extra experiences. For a Christian, there is no more important relationship than the one we have with Jesus. We know that our relationship and acceptance with Jesus is based solely on our faith, but once our faith is placed, are there any other extras that come along with this relationship? This week, Peter will help us see that indeed our relationship with Jesus does carry with it a few extras. Even though at first these extras might seem challenging or intimidating, in truth they are a great blessing. And as we see that, Jesus wants us to joyfully and wholeheartedly own them for ourselves.
