In the first half of Acts 15, the major issue was a theological question: "What is required for salvation?" The Church leaders in Jerusalem agreed that all people are saved by grace through faith. The issue that we see in the second part of this chapter centers more on how the Christian life is lived out in a culturally dititle world. With our new identity in Jesus comes a new way of living that seeks to establish and grow God's Kingdom across all cultures.
