One of the realities of being human is that everyone believes something to make sense of the world and their life in it. Most people don't have too hard a time explaining what they believe. However, many people do have a hard time answering because they don't know why. That missing "why" is one of the worst in the world. The good news this week is that God wants to replace that angst and apathy with joy and courage by calling us to live an honest life in the gospel.
