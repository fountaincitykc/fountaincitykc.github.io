Advent is a season of great hope and in days like ours, we need hope. All of us, no matter our background, circumstances, beliefs, long for something to give us rest in our souls and lead us to rejoice in our hearts, because all of us experience what this passage describes as gloom. Often we look at our lives or we look at this world and we ask, "Can anyone lead us out of this mess?!" The good news of advent is "Yes. Jesus, our Wonderful Counselor".
