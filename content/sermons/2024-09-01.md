These two brief verses are some of the most powerful in all the Bible. They have not only changed lives, but have literally sparked a world-changing movement. Their focus is the gospel, a message we hear and celebrate often. And that's because in the gospel, there is power, there is the righteousness of God, and there is life of faith.
