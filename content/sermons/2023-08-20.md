As we close up this amazing little book, God will continue to demonstrate his limitless grace and goodness.  Even in tragedy, God is at work for good.  With God in our lives, we are never without hope.  Because of our security in Christ, we can take on any risk with courage.  And now, as we'll see, whether it takes four years or four generations, God's will will be done, and in his grace he will bless anyone who takes refuge in him.
