One of the more confusing realities of the Christian faith is perhaps the part we interact with the most: the Church. What exactly is THE church? In our modern context it's easy to connect church with a building or a social club or non-profit that helps us grow but as we'll see this week, none of that gets close to what the Church really is. As Peter will show us, the church is a community of born-again people saved to be with God and bless the world.
