During these few summer weeks, we will be looking at a variety of different passages and hearing from a number of voices.  As we move through the Church calendar, we currently are enjoying what has traditionally been called "Ordinary Time". This is a time for us to enjoy the slower, simpler rhythm of the summer months, resting in God's sovereign grace in all moments and seasons.
