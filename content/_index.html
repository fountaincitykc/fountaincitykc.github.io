  content: "There are many successful people who work hard, achieve nearly all they want, but in the end wind up feeling empty and unfulfilled. What is it in life that actually satisfies us? What will give us the REST that we all long for: the peace, the joy, the fulfillment? From this passage, we'll see that the answer has to do with one key issue: worship. What we worship determines whether or not we find the rest we long for."
