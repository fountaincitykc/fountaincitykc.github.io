  contentHTML: "<p>In our passage, we will come up against perhaps God's great concern for us; the question, \"what does God want from us?\" As you go about each day, your tasks, your decisions, your conversations, your relationships, does God want anything from you? We see that yes, he does. And what he wants has everything to do with two things: his Word and Belief.</p>"
