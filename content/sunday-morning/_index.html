  content: "Fountain City is filled with young families. As we seek to help each child grow in his or her knowledge and love of God, families are invited to worship together for portions of the service. Nursery is available for children ages 0–3, and a worship class for kids ages 3–6 during the sermon. Kids 7 and up join their parents and receive age-appropriate materials to engage them during the sermon. Our Children & Families ministry assists parents in training up children as faithful followers of Jesus."
