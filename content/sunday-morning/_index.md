      Fountain City is a church that values community and connection which you will notice right away. No matter your age or background, you will find a place here. The service usually lasts about an hour and fifteen minutes. Attire varies – generally casual. You are more than welcome to stick around after service and get to know people. We are so glad to have you worship with us and can’t wait to meet you.

      Fountain City is filled with young families. As we seek to help each child grow in his or her knowledge and love of God, families are invited to worship together for portions of the service. Nursery is available for children ages 0–3, and a worship class for kids ages 3–6 during the sermon. Kids 7 and up join their parents and receive age-appropriate materials to engage them during the sermon. Our Children & Families ministry assists parents in training up children as faithful followers of Jesus.

      Johnson County Arts and Heritage Center is our newest meeting location as of January 2025. Over the past two years, the Lord has continued to grow our church community to the point that we have outgrown our previous location at the Meadowbrook Park Clubhouse. We have loved our time at Meadowbrook, but we feel the Lord leading us to move. We want to be able to welcome as many people in worship as we can and, as a young growing church plant, we need more room to be able to grow into a church for generations to come.
