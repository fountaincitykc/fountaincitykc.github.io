        James is a Colorado native, and graduated from Calvin University where
        he studied Biology. He then earned his Master of Divinity (M. Div) from
        Denver Seminary while serving in the missions department of Cherry Hills
        Community Church. From there, he and Lindsay were on staff with Cru in
        both the Denver and Kansas City areas before planting Fountain City
        Church.


        As pastor of Fountain City, James loves preaching and teaching about
        God's grace to us in Jesus Christ. He is passionate about followers of
        Jesus maturing in their life of discipleship, and he has a strong desire
        to help the gospel of Jesus go to parts of the world where it is yet to
        be heard.


        James and Lindsay have 3 children. James loves just about any team
        sport, and he's is most content when fly fishing, preferably for trout.

        Risha loves engaging the next generation with the gospel and inviting
        children, students, and their families to know and love God above all
        else and to trust him in all things through faith in Jesus Christ.


        Risha grew up in Texas and studied Journalism at Texas A&M University
        before moving to Kansas City, where she met her husband, Mark, and they
        became a blended family with four young children. After experiencing
        God’s grace through the joys and struggles of family life and serving in
        several ministry contexts, Risha felt called to family ministry and
        earned a Master of Divinity (M. Div) from Gordon Conwell Theological
        Seminary. With seminary complete, Risha is looking forward to creating a
        discipleship pathway for children and students and finding new ways to
        support parents and strengthen families at Fountain City Church.


        In her free time, Risha enjoys spending time with friends and family,
        reading, and exploring new parts of God’s creation.
