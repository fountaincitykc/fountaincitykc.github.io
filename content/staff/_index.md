    - name: James Cottier

        James is a Colorado native, and graduated from Calvin University where
        he studied Biology. He then earned his Master of Divinity (M. Div) from
        Denver Seminary while serving in the missions department of Cherry Hills
        Community Church. From there, he and Lindsay were on staff with Cru in
        both the Denver and Kansas City areas before planting Fountain City
        Church.

        As pastor of Fountain City, James loves preaching and teaching about
        God's grace to us in Jesus Christ. He is passionate about followers of
        Jesus maturing in their life of discipleship, and he has a strong desire
        to help the gospel of Jesus go to parts of the world where it is yet to
        be heard.

        James and Lindsay have 3 children. James loves just about any team
        sport, and he's is most content when fly fishing, preferably for trout.

    - name: Risha Flannagan
      role: Children's and Family Ministry Director

        Risha is passionate about teaching the Bible in a way that connects
        Jesus Christ with young minds and hearts and invites children and
        students into God's grand redemptive narrative. Risha also enjoys
        encouraging and empowering parents to be spiritual leaders in their
        homes.

        Risha's love for family ministry grew in her home as she witnessed the
        love and grace of God work powerfully in her family. Risha was raised in
        Texas and studied Journalism at Texas A&M University before moving to
        Kansas City, where she met her husband, Mark, in their adjoining
        backyards. After marriage, they became a blended family with four
        children under three years old. Now that her children are nearly grown,
        Risha feels she can relate to the struggles many parents experience and
        she looks forward to sharing the hope of Christ with families.

        Risha is pursuing a Master of Divinity (M. Div) through Gordon Conwell
        Theological Seminary.

        Lindsay is from Cleveland, Ohio and graduated from Miami University
        having studied Education and History. She moved to Denver to marry James
        as he completed seminary, and has worked in various ministry roles with
        Cru and the local church.

        Helping people connect to Jesus and connect to community are some of
        Lindsay's greatest joys in ministry.

        Lindsay loves raising her 3 favorite children alongside James.
