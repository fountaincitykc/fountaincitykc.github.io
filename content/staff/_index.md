      James is a Colorado native, and graduated from Calvin University where he studied Biology. He then earned his Master of Divinity (M. Div) from Denver Seminary while serving in the missions department of Cherry Hills Community Church. From there, he and Lindsay were on staff with Cru in both the Denver and Kansas City areas before planting Fountain City Church.

      As pastor of Fountain City, James loves preaching and teaching about God's grace to us in Jesus Christ. He is passionate about followers of Jesus maturing in their life of discipleship, and he has a strong desire to help the gospel of Jesus go to parts of the world where it is yet to be heard.

      James and Lindsay have 3 children. James loves just about any team sport, and he's is most content when fly fishing, preferably for trout.

      A KC native, Alex studied worship arts at John Brown University: a combination of worship philosophy, church history, theology, and music performance focused on voice and guitar. He spent his spare time working in the performing arts center's recording studio, rounding out the technical side of worship training.

      Alex loves seeing how the rhythms of the church calendar align with the life season of our church and how that all shapes our corporate worship during service. Each week we are able to "sing to the Lord a new song", rejoice, confess, and pray together without falling into rote worship because His mercies are always new.

      Alex married Kathryn, his high school friends and college sweetheart, and they now live in Overland Park with their cat Imogene.

      Risha is passionate about teaching the Bible in a way that connects Jesus Christ with young minds and hearts and invites children and students into God's grand redemptive narrative. Risha also enjoys encouraging and empowering parents to be spiritual leaders in their homes.

      Risha's love for family ministry grew in her home as she witnessed the love and grace of God work powerfully in her family. Risha was raised in Texas and studied Journalism at Texas A&amp;M University before moving to Kansas City, where she met her husband, Mark, in their adjoining backyards. After marriage, they became a blended family with four children under three years old. Now that her children are nearly grown, Risha feels she can relate to the struggles many parents experience and she looks forward to sharing the hope of Christ with families.

      Risha is pursuing a Master of Divinity (M. Div) through Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary.
