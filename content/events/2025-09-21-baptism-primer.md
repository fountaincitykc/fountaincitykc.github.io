Baptism is a joyful and vital step in the Christian life of discipleship, but it can be surrounded with questions and confusion. Who should get baptized? When? Why? What does one need to do in order to be baptized? How can I or my child receive baptism at Fountain City? Anyone is invited to join us after the Sunday Service for this succinct, half-hour primer on baptism during which we'll answer these questions and more.
