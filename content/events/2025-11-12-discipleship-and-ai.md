With the rise of Artificial Intelligence in the last three years, AI has gone from the fringes of society to the center of our shared life together. Join us as we have an in-depth discussion about what it means to follow Jesus in the age of AI. This will not be a tech-heavy but discipleship-heavy conversation. Whether you love technology or hate it, the reality is that AI is here to stay and we wonâ€™t experience life without it. Dinner will be provided, as will childcare for ages 0-4th grade. We want to make this as easy as possible for anyone to attend, and all are welcome.
