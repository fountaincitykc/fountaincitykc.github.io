date: 2023-10-08

We will begin our next New Members Class. The New Members Class is the first step for anyone wanting to become an official member of Fountain City Church. This class is also a great opportunity for anyone wanting to learn more about Fountain City (e.g. our denomination, what we believe, our mission and vision). The class will begin at 9:00am before the service with light refreshments and childcare provided. (The class will continue on October 22).
