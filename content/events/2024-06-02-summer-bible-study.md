FCC will be helping kids learn to study the bible for themselves with a family bible study through a survey study of the New Testament produced by _Not Consumed Ministries_. The study comes with age appropriate books for kids ages 2-4, 5-7, 8-12, teens and adults. This is an awesome opportunity for our church to pursue making disciples of Jesus in the next generation.
