This class serves as the first step in officially or formally becoming a member of the church, and it also doubles as an informational meeting for anyone wanting to learn more about FCC. That means anyone is welcome to join in on the class. If you are interested and would like to know more information, please reach out to myself or Pastor James after the service for more information.
