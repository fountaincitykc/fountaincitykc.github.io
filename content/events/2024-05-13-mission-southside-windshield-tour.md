Join us on a tour of Mission Southside to learn more about how God is at work in the communities they serve.

<!--more-->

We will load up on the bus and travel around to see the different neighborhoods they work with. We have seats for 14 people and since the tour is limited we ask that only one adult per family sign up. There will be a waitlist if we fill 14 spots so please register if you want to participate.
