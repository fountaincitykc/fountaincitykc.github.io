title: FCC Advent Study Kick-off
date: 2023-11-29
---
We want to be intentional with our focus on Jesus in the Christmas season, but it's often difficult to do! Join us this Advent season in a daily Bible reading plan called He Alone is Worthy. Books are available for men and women, and are $15. The study will lead you through Scripture readings and a few questions for the 40 days of Advent that lead to Christmas Eve. More details about the study can be found [here](https://www.shopshereadstruth.com/products/advent-2023-study-book-she-reads-truth). Please reach out to Lindsay (lindsay@fountaincitykc.org) if you would like to participate.
