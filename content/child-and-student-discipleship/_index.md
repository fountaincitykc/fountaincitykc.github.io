    - headline: Nursery and Toddler Class
      content: Our nursery and toddler class (8 weeks-3 years old) is a nurturing
        environment for very young children to learn that God is real, good, and
        trustworthy. Toddlers learn the attributes of God through singing, short
        Bible stories, and activities designed just for them. This class is held
        during the entire worship service.

      content: Our 4-1st grade class engages young kids with an overview of God’s big
        story to cultivate young hearts with a sense of wonder and awe in the
        God who made them, loves them, and sent His Son Jesus for them. This
        class is held during the sermon portion of the worship service.

    questions:
      - question: Do you have safety measures in place?
        answer: All adults working with children at FCC undergo a background screening,
          abuse prevention training, and age-specific training led by FCC
          Leadership, and agree to the Children’s and Family Ministry Safety
          Procedures and Protocol, which is available to parents upon request.
          Two adults are required to be with children at all times. Children
          must be checked into our electronic system and are released only with
          a security sticker that matches the child’s sticker. FCC Kids’ Leaders
          do not take children to the restroom; parents will be notified via
          text message if kids need a bathroom break.
      - question: Why does Fountain City Church include kids in the worship service?
        answer: FCC highly values the presence of children in worship because kids are
          an important part of the church, and they learn to worship best
          alongside their families in the context of community. Children are
          able to understand a lot more than we often think. Also, including
          kids in worship gives families shared experiences and common language
          to use at home when talking about God and the Bible. Because of this,
          classes for children 4 and older are held only during the sermon
          portion of worship. Stop by the Family Welcome Center to learn about
          the materials available for children attending worship.
      - question: How can I get involved in FCC Kids?
        answer: Once you complete [this
          application](https://fountaincitykc.churchcenter.com/people/forms/1066663),
          a leader from Fountain City Church will reach out to you. We can't
          wait to connect with you!
