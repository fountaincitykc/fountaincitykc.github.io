title: Advent
---

Every year, the Advent season helps to orient our vision and our attention to the goal of our faith, the hope of our faith. This season reminds us that we are waiting for fullness. The good news of the Gospel begins with a promise running throughout the entirety of the Scripture that then finds its fulfillment in the final and full return and victory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2,000 years ago, Jesus, the King of Kings, was born to us in a manger and then died for us on a cross. And now we wait for him to come again and complete what his first advent began, as he will make all things new and lead us, his people, into his eternal Kingdom full of light, peace, and joy.
