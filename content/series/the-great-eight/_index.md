Throughout Church history, the book of Romans has largely been considered the greatest book in the book in the Bible, and the eighth chapter the greatest section of the book. Of all the writings of Scripture, Romans chapter eight most clearly frames for us what difference the gospel's truth and power makes in our lives. If Jesus Christ really rose from the dead — and he did; and if God's promises to us through the gospel are true — which they are; how does all this affect how I live my life?  How does it shape how I see myself, my circumstances, my future? Through this amazing portion of Scripture, Paul will show us that the gospel makes all the difference in the world.
