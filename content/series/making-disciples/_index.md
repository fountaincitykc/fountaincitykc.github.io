Central to our vision and calling as a church is the work of making disciples. We have it in our vision statement: A Christ centered church making and sending disciples in this generation and the next. Over the next four weeks, we are going to dive into this phrase, "making disciples". We'll explore the vision and goal of this calling, and we'll explore the how within it: how we will make disciples. The aim of this series is not to focus on the academic or strategic, but to get personal. Who are you as a disciple? Are you a disciple of Jesus? As a disciple, to what might Jesus be calling you? As a disciple, how might Jesus invite you to be part of the work of making new disciples?
