title: 1 Peter

1 Peter is a letter that speaks with power and relevance to any audience, regardless of the cultural moment or social location. Nearly 2,000 years ago, the Apostle Peter wrote to Christians doing their best to navigate difficult circumstances in a culture where they felt out of place. Though our circumstances today are surely different and our context foreign, as Christians, our experiences are not. We too know the discomfort of feeling out of place, of change all around us, of a calling as disciples of Jesus that challenges us. And we too need the truth, vision and encouragement Peter gives. In this letter we will not only be further rooted in riches of the gospel, we will also grow in understanding what difference our faith in Jesus makes in our real lives in our real, day-to-day circumstances.
