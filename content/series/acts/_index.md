title: Acts

As we study the book of Acts, we will pursue the answer to the question, **"now what?"**. What happens now that Jesus has brought salvation? What have the past 2,000 years been about? What is the church and what role does it have?

More personally, we'll engage this question: Jesus has come and brought salvation for all who will receive...**now what?** We'll also ask, "I've become a Christian...**now what?**" OR "I've become a Christian...how does that affect my sense of identity and purpose?" 

What Acts will show us is that our **now what** is not some kind of boring, anticlimactic wrap-up project, but the next stage in God's ongoing project of world-wide redemption.
