title: The Next Chapter
---

This past October, Fountain City Church celebrated our four-year anniversary. These first four years were full of high and lows, unexpected twists and turns, and some amazing Spiritual fruit. As we look ahead and think about the next four years, where do we sense God is leading us? Who do we believe God is calling us to be? What do we think he is calling us to do? In short, what's our vision? Over the next eight weeks we will answer these questions and explore the sense of calling and vision we believe God is giving to us, Fountain City Church: A Christ centered church making and sending disciples in this generation and the next.
