title: Proverbs â€” Life Lived Well 
---

Every day we make dozens of decisions. We form plans, pursue goals, navigate relationships. And we do all this in the real world of everyday life. Rarely, however, do we slow down to ask, are we living this life well? The norm is for us to get swept up in the currents of our society and its accepted customs and values and ambitions, assuming that we're headed in a good direction. But are we? In the book of Proverbs, God has given us a guide to a good life, to a life lived well. That's because a good life is a life led wisely, a life of wisdom, and the aim of Proverbs is to make us wise. In this series we will explore what wisdom actually is and where we acquire it. We will look at various traits of wise people, traits like teachability and humility. And we'll also grow in our understanding of what wise behavior looks like in areas like our words and our wealth, in friendship, and leadership.
