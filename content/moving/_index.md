#### Why are we moving?

Over the past two years, the Lord has continued to grow our church community to the point that we have outgrown our current location at the Meadowbrook Park Clubhouse. We have loved our time at Meadowbrook, but we feel the Lord leading us to move. We want to be able to welcome as many people in worship as we can and, as a young growing church plant, we need more room to be able to grow into a church for generations to come. 

#### Where are we moving?

We are moving our primary gathering location for all Sunday services as well as all all-church functions to the Johnson County Arts & Heritage Center at 89th & Metcalf Ave in Overland Park, KS.

#### Why are we moving to this location?

There are many reasons. To begin with, it’s close to where we’ve been gathering for the past few years and we desire to maintain a close connection with that community. It’s also a beautiful and inviting building that provides plenty of room for Fountain City to continue to grow, especially with our kids…there’s lots of room for kids! We love that we’ll be intimately connected to a hub of Overland Park. And we’re excited to continue enjoying our relationship with the Johnson County administration and hopefully be able to serve our community together. 

#### Will this affect any of our meeting times?

No. We will continue meeting at 10am on Sundays. 

#### Will this affect whether we have kids programming?

No. We will continue to have all current kids programming and be able to add more as we grow. 

#### Where do I enter and what can I expect?

You will enter through the main entrance at the front of the building. A greeter will be there to welcome you and direct you to next steps. Once inside, you can expect a bright and welcoming atmosphere with plenty of space. 

#### Where’s the kids check-in?

Kids check-in will be located just a few steps within the main entrance. Our team will be there to welcome you and help you get all your little ones ready for the morning. 

#### What part of the building will we be using?

For worship and all-church events, we will be using the main event space that is off to the left of the main entry. We will also use a room attached to that space for our primary kids class. We will also be using a large conference room toward the front of the building as a nursery. As we grow, we will be able to use more rooms as needed. 


#### Do we have the entire building to ourselves?

No. Because this is a large facility with many rentable spaces, it’s possible though not likely there could be a group using the space at the same time. However, our location within the building will be secluded and just for us. Plus, we will have exclusive access to an enclosed outdoor courtyard just off the worship space.
