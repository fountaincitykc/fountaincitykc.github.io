  - headline: Nursery and Toddler Class
    content: |-
      Our Nursery/Toddler Class welcomes children eight weeks to three years old during worship and is led by our screened and trained adult FCC Kids’ Leaders. The Nursery/Toddler Class is a nurturing environment for children to learn that God is real, good, and trustworthy through loving, attentive, and secure care. Toddlers learn the attributes of God through singing, short Bible stories, and activities designed just for them. 

      If you would like to place your child in the Nursery/Toddler Class, please stop by the Family Welcome Center when you arrive on Sunday morning. An FCC Kids’ Leader will check your child into our electronic system, give you the security sticker needed for pick-up, and take your family to the Nursery/Toddler Class. Should your child need you for any reason during worship, we will notify you via text message.

  - headline: Four Years Old through First Grade
    content: |-
      Children four years old through the first grade are invited to join our Kids’ Worship Class, which is held during the sermon portion of worship. Our Worship Class provides an overview of God’s redemptive narrative, invites young children to see how their story fits into God’s story, and cultivates young hearts with a sense of wonder and awe in a big God who made them and loves them.

      When you arrive, stop by the Family Welcome Center, where we will check your child into our electronic system. Children participate in worship with their families and then are released for the Worship Class right before the sermon. Our screened and trained FCC Kids’ Leaders take kids to their class, and parents are always welcome to accompany their children. Our leaders will take children back into worship at the end of the sermon. If children need to use the restroom during class, parents will be notified via text.

    questions:
    - question: Do you have safety measures in place?
      answer: |-
        All adults working with children at FCC undergo a background screening, abuse prevention training, and age-specific training led by FCC Leadership, and agree to the Children’s and Family Ministry Safety Procedures and Protocol, which is available to parents upon request. Two adults are required to be with children at all times. Children must be checked into our electronic system and are released only with a security sticker that matches the child’s sticker. FCC Kids’ Leaders do not take children to the restroom; parents will be notified via text message if kids need a bathroom break.
    - question: Why does Fountain City Church include kids in the worship service?
      answer: |-
        FCC highly values the presence of children in worship because kids are an important part of the church, and they learn to worship best alongside their families in the context of community. Children are able to understand a lot more than we often think. Also, including kids in worship gives families shared experiences and common language to use at home when talking about God and the Bible. Because of this, classes for children 4 and older are held only during the sermon portion of worship. Stop by the Family Welcome Center to learn about the materials available for children attending worship.
    - question: What about older elementary kids and students (6th-12th grades)?
      answer: |-
        We are in the process of creating a class during the sermon portion of worship for children in the 2nd-5th grade and a discipleship opportunity for students.
    - question: How can I get involved in FCC Kids?
      answer: |-
        Once you complete [this application](https://fountaincitykc.churchcenter.com/people/forms/1066663), a leader from Fountain City Church will reach out to you. We can't wait to connect with you!
